## Types of reaction

On the basic of nature 
### Irreverisble Reaction:
An irreversible reaction is a chemical reaction that proceeds in one direction only and cannot be easily reversed.  

Eg : Combustion of Hydrocarbons  [![fire](https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/fire.png)](https://emoji.gg/emoji/fire)
  
$$\ce{CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H20(l)}$$

### Reversible Reaction:

A reversible reaction is a chemical reaction that can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions under certain conditions. 
In other words, the reactants can convert into products, and the products can also revert back to the original reactants.   

Eg: Formation of Ammonia (Haber Process)
$$\ce{N2(g) + 3H2(g) <=> 2NH3(g)}$$

### Equilibrium State
The equilibrium state refers to a condition in a chemical reaction where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, and the concentrations of reactants and products remain relatively constant over time. At equilibrium, there is no net change in the amount of reactants and products.

### Characterstics of Equilibrium

- Dynamic in Nature
- At Equilibrium $\Delta G = 0$
- At equilibrium , their is no change in any of the measurable [Volume , mass , Pressure and MOle]
- Equilibrium cacn be achieved from both direction [FD or BD]
- There will be no effect on equilibrium after adding catalyst.

### Law of Mass Action

Acc. to this , Rate of forward reaction is directly proptionl to product of active mass of Rectant and rate of backward reaction is directyl Proptional of Active mass of Product.  

$$\ce{A + B <=> C + D }$$
$$\ce{Rectant  <=> Product}$$

Rectant :
$$r_f \propto [A][B]$$ 
$$r_f = K_f [A][B]$$   

Product:

$$r_b \propto [C][D]$$   
$$r_b = K_b [C][D]$$  

Where , $K_f$ = Rate of Forward reaction  
 $K_b$ = Rate of Backward reaction  

 **Note** : These constant change only with temperature.

At Equilibrium $\to  r_f = r_b$

$$k_f [A][B] = K_b[C][D]$$
$$ K_{eq} = \frac{K_f}{k_b} = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}$$

$$\large\fbox{$K_{eq}= \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}$  }$$

eg: 
1. $$\ce{2A + B <=> 3C + D}$$
   $$\large k_{eq}= \frac{[C]^3[D]}{[A]^2[B]}$$
2. $$\ce{N2(g) + 3H2(g) <=>2NH3(g)}$$
   $$\large \ce{ K_{eq} = \frac{[NH3]^2}{[ N2][H2]^3}}$$
